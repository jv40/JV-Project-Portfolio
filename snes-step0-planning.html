    <p> I’m writing this on the bus back home by the way. I’m really excited to start this project! Today is day one of this little project of mine: creating an SNES emulator from scratch. I say little, but I know that it’s going to be a massive undertaking for me, especially for my freshman year of college. I decided to do it since my conversation with a mentor of mine. He mentioned that he created a Gameboy Emulator a while back to learn a lot about programming while enjoying the process, so I hope to do the same with my own SNES emulator. I say “enjoy” loosely however, because there are CERTAINLY times that I’m going to be in a rut. It’s during those tough times though, that my perseverance will be tested, and my passion for coding will get me through. And also the fact that I’ve been really meaning to play Chrono Trigger. BRO. I know I’m gonna finish my code, boot up Chrono Trigger successfully at some point after that, then while running the game it’s going to crash because of some unaccounted for bug. If that happens, highkey I don’t know if I’m finishing that game. Hopefully it doesn’t though.
        </br></br>
            As Day One, I’ve begun looking into emulators and gathering references so I can learn more. The more I look into emulators though, the more I realize I have a LOT to learn. It’s probably going to be a WHILE (a month maybe) until I begin coding. When I do, I don’t even know what to test first. I’m looking at this project as a monolith right now, as just starting the code and finishing it. But there for sure are different sections and ways for me to test that my code is working. I just need to figure out what they are. Do I need to mess with the internals of my computer though for this project? I’m not sure, but I hope not. Right now I’m thinking my first big step would be studying the SNES architecture (which also entails understanding how data is stored and manipulated in a computer, and maybe a bit of assembly?). Once I’m done studying that, then the first step for coding should be to start coding the CPU, so the first step there would be to build a working internal clock which the fake CPU’s internal processes can run on. Then I need to define the CPU’s opcodes. That’s just what I’m thinking right now from the little bit that I’ve researched right now, I’ll probably figure out more later.
        </br></br>
            OOH I have a great idea. As quick practice, why don’t I make my own blog website??? I might as well since I’m going to be logging my journey in this Google Doc anyways. It’ll be good for brushing up on my front end programming skills anyways.

    <p>     Good news. I made that blog website. If you’re reading this right now it’s probably on said blog website! Pretty cool huh! I think I spent around 5-8 hours on it yesterday and it’s looking pretty good right now. It isn’t formatted for mobile devices yet but for now, this will have to do. I don’t really want to bother with formatting it for that right now but I might come back to it another time.
        </br></br>
        In any case, I’m dedicating today to writing notes on what I can learn about how to even go about this whole process. This, by the way, is where I’d imagine a lot of the value of this blog lies: research notes. I’ll try to condense them like I would regular notes in a college class, and in doing so I’ll learn a lot, and you can learn a lot using my notes! It’s a win-win situation! I’ll even add pictures actually. Here you go, a picture of my current Project Outline!
