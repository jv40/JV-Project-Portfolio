        <p>Starting out this project, I found a lot of incredibly detailed documentation but not enough suitable for a relative beginner like myself. Either that, or the author of whichever supposed "full-process" blog post I was reading quit mid-way, sometimes only at step one. I get it, it's a difficult undertaking, and condensing everything from the beginning is a lot of work.
            </br></br>
            Which is why that isn't what I'm doing. I'm just documenting my process of building this emulator from scratch. Hopefully, by reading my journey through creating this SNES emulator, you'll be able to get not only a general overview of how you can go about it as well, but also get a sense of some of the bumps and hiccups that will come along throughout the process
            </br></br>
            Either way, this is a long journey and as of writing this, it's only just beginning. Let's go!
